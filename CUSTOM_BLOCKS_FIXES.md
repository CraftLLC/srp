# Custom Blocks System Fixes (Minecraft 1.21.1)

## Problem
The custom blocks system had issues with `item_display` entities not being properly removed when blocks were broken, causing orphaned entities to remain in the world.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved Block Breaking Logic**
- **File**: `data/custom_blocks/function/super_block/break.mcfunction`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `minecraft:` prefix to all commands for plugin compatibility
  - Improved item cleanup to remove red stained glass drops with wider radius (3 blocks)
  - Enhanced entity cleanup to remove all `item_display` entities with `custom_blocks.super_block` tag at the location
  - Added comprehensive comments for better understanding

### 2. **Enhanced Detection System**
- **File**: `data/custom_blocks/function/super_block/super_block.mcfunction`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `minecraft:` prefix for plugin compatibility
  - Added tagging system to mark entities for removal
  - Improved block detection logic with better comments

### 3. **Automatic Cleanup System**
- **File**: `data/custom_blocks/function/tick.mcfunction`
- **Changes**:
  - Added periodic cleanup every 100 ticks (5 seconds)
  - Implemented scoreboard-based timer system
  - Added `minecraft:` prefix for all commands

### 4. **New Cleanup Functions**
- **File**: `data/custom_blocks/function/cleanup_orphaned.mcfunction`
  - Removes orphaned `item_display` entities that don't have corresponding blocks
  - Handles entities marked for removal
  - Comprehensive cleanup for all custom block types

- **File**: `data/custom_blocks/function/manual_cleanup.mcfunction`
  - Manual cleanup command for admins/players
  - Provides feedback on number of entities cleaned
  - Useful for troubleshooting and maintenance

### 5. **Initialization System**
- **File**: `data/custom_blocks/function/load.mcfunction`
  - Initializes scoreboard objectives
  - Sets up cleanup timer
  - Provides load confirmation message

- **File**: `data/minecraft/tags/function/load.json`
  - Added `custom_blocks:load` to load functions
  - Ensures proper initialization on datapack load

### 6. **Improved Placement System**
- **Files**: `placed_item_frame.mcfunction`, `check_placed_item_frame.mcfunction`, `place.mcfunction`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `minecraft:` prefix for plugin compatibility
  - Enhanced comments and documentation
  - Improved code structure

### 7. **Testing and Debugging**
- **File**: `data/custom_blocks/function/test_system.mcfunction`
  - Comprehensive testing function
  - System status display
  - Usage instructions
  - Entity counting and monitoring

## Key Features

### Plugin Compatibility
- All commands use `minecraft:` prefix to prevent conflicts with server plugins
- Ensures commands work correctly on servers with custom command handlers

### Robust Cleanup
- Multiple layers of cleanup: immediate, periodic, and manual
- Handles edge cases where entities might not be removed immediately
- Prevents accumulation of orphaned entities

### Performance Optimized
- Cleanup runs every 5 seconds instead of every tick
- Uses efficient entity selectors
- Minimal performance impact on server

### User-Friendly
- Clear error messages and feedback
- Test functions for verification
- Manual cleanup options for admins

## Usage

### For Players:
1. Use `/function custom_blocks:give_items` to get custom block items
2. Place item frames to create custom blocks
3. Break blocks normally - cleanup is automatic

### For Admins:
1. Use `/function custom_blocks:test_system` to test the system
2. Use `/function custom_blocks:manual_cleanup` for manual cleanup
3. Monitor system with scoreboard: `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar custom_blocks`

### For Developers:
- All functions are well-documented with comments
- Modular design allows easy extension
- Clear separation of concerns between functions
